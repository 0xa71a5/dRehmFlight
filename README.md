# dRehmFlight
Teensy based, no BS flight controller for all types of VTOL platforms.

## Overview
This project is a work in progress, and was originally developed for research vehicle platforms at the University of Maryland Alfred Gessow Rotorcraft Center. Simply put, engineers and hobbyists may not possess the required software skillset to fully understand other flight control software packages available today. We are not all software engineers, and that's okay. This software package is an attempt to develope an easy to understand flight controller solution that can easily be modified for almost any vehicle configuration. The flight control code follows a sequential step-by-step method to achieve full functionality that is easy to follow, debug, and modify for your purposes. The code is designed to run on a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller with the mpu6050 IMU. The code is compiled and uploaded to the board using a slightly modified version of the arduino environment, teensyduino. 

Full disclosure: I am not a sotware engineer, and my code has never been perfect. I barely know how to use github. This code is meant to be easy to understand and follow along, NOT be highly optimized. The Teensy 4.0 board allows for some sloppy, unoptimized code to run at more than adequate speeds for our purposes. This code, while not "industry standard," should allow anyone who is technically inclined to follow along relatively easily.
